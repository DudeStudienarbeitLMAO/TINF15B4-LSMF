# Sets up a LAMP stack environment using CentOS 7, PHP 5.6, MySQL 5.6, and Apache.
# Also installs PHPUnit and XDebug.

# This software/script is released under the terms of the MIT license (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
# 1. Copy this shell script to your home directory or the /tmp directory.
# 2. Make it executable with the following command: 
#      chmod a+x setup-lamp-stack-on-cent-os-7.sh
# 3. Execute the script as a sudo user:
#      sudo ./setup-lamp-stack-on-cent-os-7.sh
#
#
# IMPORTANT: as of this writing on 2015-01-11, this shell script will support
# CentOS 6.4, 6.5, and 7. It has not been tested on a release greater than
# v7. That is 7 flat, not 7.1, 7.x.
#
# If you wish to use this script with a version of CentOS greater than v7 such as
# 7.1 or higher when they come out, you have to edit this script to be sure that the IUS and EPEL
# repositories correctly use the repos needed for newer versions of CentOS. The
# same applies to all other areas in this file where there is a check for an exact
# version of CentOS before doing a download and/or installation.
#
# It's important to point out that this script assumes that none of the binaries 
# that are to be installed are already present on the target server. If you already
# have the EPEL repository installed on your target server, you should first remove it
# by following the instructions in this link:
#
# http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/centos-redhat-fedora-linux-remote-yum-repo-configuration/
#



# Since this script needs to be runnable on either CentOS7 or CentOS6, we need to first 
# check which version of CentOS that we are running and place that into a variable.
# Knowing the version of CentOS is important because some shell commands that had
# worked in CentOS 6 or earlier no longer work under CentOS 7
